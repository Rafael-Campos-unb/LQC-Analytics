# LQC Analytics

## Overview

LQC Analytics is a specialized software for exploratory data analysis that implements unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify complex patterns in multivariate datasets. The program was specifically developed to facilitate the application of advanced statistical techniques - K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - in an integrated and interactive way, allowing users without deep technical knowledge to perform sophisticated analyses intuitively.
